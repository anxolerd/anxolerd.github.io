Here are my slides

- [Buildsystems][kpi-buildsystems]. I talked about buildsystems in general at
  the university. I talked about why buildsystems are used and shown a simple
  [demo][kpi-buildsystems-demo] on Gulp buildsystem.
- [VCS: Three letters that can change your life][kpi-vcs]. I prepared these
  slides for my talk at the university about importance of Version Control
  Systems for developer.
- [Effective git][evo-git]. I talked at Evo Summer Python Lab'16 (summer
  internship at EVO.company) about Git VCS. I made a demonstration about _how
  to make a commit in the hard way_ using low-level Git commands as well as I
  show some interesting features of Git, that can be useful.
- [A-Frame][aframe-vr]. I gave a talk about how to make VR experiences in
  browser using A-Frame library for that. During the talk I performed a
  [live-coding session][aframe-vr-sample] where I showed the very basics as well
  as demonstrated a more complicated project: small [game][aframe-vr-game] which
  is all about defending the tower from evil boxes.
