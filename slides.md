Here are my slides

- [Buildsystems][kpi-buildsystems]. I talked about buildsystems in general at the university. I talked about why buildsystems are used and shown a simple [demo][kpi-buildsystems-demo] on Gulp buildsystem.
- [VCS: Three letters that can change your life][kpi-vcs]. I prepared these slides for my talk at the university about importance of Version Control Systems for developer.
- [Effective git][evo-git]. I talked at Evo Summer Python Lab'16 (summer internship at EVO.company) about Git VCS. I made a demonstration about _how to make a commit in the hard way_ using low-level Git commands as well as I show some interesting features of Git, that can be useful.
