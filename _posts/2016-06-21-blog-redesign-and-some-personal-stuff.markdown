I spent a previous evening discovering [@notwaldorf's github][notwaldorf-github]. I've found a lot of silly but at the same time amazing projects. That was a great inspiration for me. Moreover, I've finally understood why [my github][my-github] is so boring. Probably I should stop trying to make somethin big and useful and just code some silly thing, just fot fun.

Among different projects, I liked [Monica's blog][monica-blog]. I looked at my boring pseudo-material blog and understood, that I have to do something with it. This redesign was inspired by [Hyde][hyde-theme] for jekyll. I did not want to copy-paste or fork the existing theme, so I decided to make it by myself. If you find any bugs (and you probably will) please, let me know about them.
