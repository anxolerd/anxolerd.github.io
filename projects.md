Here are some projects I used to create just for fun or for some bigger reason:

- [Vigenere tool][vigenere-tool] is a fully clientside encryption/decryption tool for vigenere cipher. My friends and me used it to prepare quest for our networks exam. You can [play with it][vigenere-tool-prod] right now.
