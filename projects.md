Here are some projects I used to create just for fun or for some bigger reason:

- [Vigenere tool][vigenere-tool] is a fully clientside encryption/decryption tool for vigenere cipher. My friends and me used it to prepare quest for our networks exam. You can [play with it][vigenere-tool-prod] right now.
- [PlannerVR][planner-vr] is a simple WebVR application which allows users to plan the room. Demonstration is [deployed to github pages][planner-vr-prod], so you can easily play with it.
