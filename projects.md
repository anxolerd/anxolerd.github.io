Here are some projects I used to create just for fun or for some bigger reason:

- [Vigenere tool][vigenere-tool] is a fully clientside encryption/decryption
  tool for vigenere cipher. My friends and I used it to prepare quest for our
  networks exam. You can [try it][vigenere-tool-prod] right now.

- [PlannerVR][planner-vr] is a simple WebVR application which allows users to
  plan the room. Demonstration is [deployed to github pages][planner-vr-prod],
  so you can easily play with it.

- [Game Of Life][gol] is a Conway's Game of Life implementation in Rust
  programming language using Piston engine for rendering.
