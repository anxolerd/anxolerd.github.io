Hi, I'm Oleksandr, a.k.a @anxolerd. 

I'm a student and a development enthusiast. I love making presentations and finding magical code. My interests include Python, SQL data retrieval, security.

In general I believe that building better apps will make this world a little bit better, that is why I try do build them. 

I'd really appreciate any comments about this blog, cause I'm not good at writing posts and developing design and frontend layout.
